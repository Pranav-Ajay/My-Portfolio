  <h1> WELCOME </h1>
  <p>
    Greetings. I am Pranav Ajay. I am just like a normal person who studies in a university just for the sake of a degree.<br>I am presently in my late teens and on the track of becoming a tax payer. 
    This website contains all details regarding<br> me including personal ones.<br>I may be jolly and sometimes weird but I do have some qualifications that I hope will land me somewhere in the marketplace.<br> 
    The following will lead you to detailed information on me as a student.

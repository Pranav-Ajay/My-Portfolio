  <h1> WELCOME </h1>
  <p>
    Greetings. I am Pranav Ajay. I am just like a normal person who studies in a university just for the sake of a degree. I am presently in my late teens and on the track of becoming a tax payer. This website contains all details regarding me including personal ones. I may be jolly and sometimes weird but I do have some qualifications that I hope will land me somewhere in the marketplace. The following will lead you to detailed information on me as a student.

  <h1>"ABOUT ME"</h1>
  <body>
    <p>As metioned earlier,I am Pranav Ajay.I am from Kerala,India and I am presently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Artificial intelligence and data science.I did my entire schooling in Kuwait which is a country in the GCC.
    ,I was born in India and brought up in Kuwait.The lack of exposure to our Indian environment led me to pursue my college education in India.I am on the track of learning my subjects so that I get a chance to contribute something
     in this vast world.Being brought up in Kuwait doesn't make me fee different as I was amongst our own community or in general the South Asian community in Kuwait.I had studied in an indian school named <a href="https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Indian_Community_School">"ICSK"</a>

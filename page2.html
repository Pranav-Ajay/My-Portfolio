  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <body2>
    <p2>As metioned earlier,I am Pranav Ajay.I am a 19 year old teen from Kerala,India and I am presently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Artificial intelligence and data science
       .I did my entire schooling in Kuwait which is a country in the GCC.I was born in India and brought up in Kuwait.The lack of exposure to our Indian environment 
       led me to pursue my college education in India.I am on the track of learning my subjects so that I get a chance to contribute something in this vast world.
       Being brought up in Kuwait doesn't make me fee different as I was amongst our own community or in general the South Asian community in Kuwait.I had studied in
       an indian school named <a href="https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Indian_Community_School">"ICSK"</a>.I was a bio-maths student in my senior secondary</p2></body2>

    <h3>PERSONAL INTEREST</h3>
   
    <p3>Ever since kindergarden,I have been developing many interests in various domains like art,building etc.When I became a teen,I started developing interests in learning more 
        about AI as I remember the word AI being used frequently by lecturers,people giving seminars,workshops and even our faculty in speeches and in motivational and career talks
        .Though I didn't learn a subject related to AI in my senoir secondary,I took part time courses relating to various programming languages in order to develop an understanding 
        on how AI works.I have great interest in statistics and web design.I am grasping the fundamentals of HTML,CSS & javascript.Regarding non academic interests,I love to bake,play
        video games and play sports like cricket and batminton</p3>

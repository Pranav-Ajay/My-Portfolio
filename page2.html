    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier, I am Pranav Ajay. I am a 19-year-old teen from Kerala, India and I am presently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
      I did my entire schooling in Kuwait, which is a country in the GCC. I was born in India and brought up in Kuwait. The lack of exposure to our Indian environment 
      led me to pursue my college education in India. I am on the track of learning my subjects so that I get a chance to contribute something in this vast world.
      Being brought up in Kuwait doesn't make me feel different as I was amongst our own community or in general the South Asian community in Kuwait. I had studied in
      an Indian school named <a href="https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Indian_Community_School" target="_blank">ICSK</a>. I was a bio-maths student in my senior secondary.
    </p>

    <h1>PERSONAL INTEREST</h1>
    <p>
      Ever since kindergarten, I have been developing many interests in various domains like art, building, etc. When I became a teen, I started developing interests in learning more 
      about AI as I remember the word AI being used frequently by lecturers, people giving seminars, workshops, and even our faculty in motivational and career talks.
      Though I didn't learn a subject related to AI in my senior secondary, I took part-time courses relating to various programming languages in order to develop an understanding 
      of how AI works. I have great interest in statistics and web design. I am grasping the fundamentals of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Regarding non-academic interests, I love to bake, play
      video games, and play sports like cricket and badminton.
    </p>

    <h1>CAREER GOALS</h1>
    <p>
      My main ambition was to get a job in the field of bioinformatics. Ever since I joined college, my interest has been shifting a bit to statistics. I just love playing with data.
      Since I also know some programming languages, I would presently prefer a career as a data scientist or a data analyst. Maybe just a statistician too. My interest keeps changing 
      based on anything new I encounter. It might not sound appealing, but in today's world people keep switching their professions at one point of their life. Hence, there is some thrill 
      in our life. My present goal is to get a decent CGPA, go for higher studies, and then focus on a good type of profession.
